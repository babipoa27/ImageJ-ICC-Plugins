ImageJ Plugins to analyize immunocytochemistry results. These plugins were developed during the Summer of 2014 at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA.

The Thresholding plugin takes in a directory of immunocytochemistry result pictures, and outputs the degree of staining within each given picture.The plugin is useful for quickly quantifying the immunocytochemistry results.
